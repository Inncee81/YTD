CHANGELOG
---------

  v0.61

    * New provider: RTA.cz.

    * New provider: Sex-Doma.cz (porn).

    * New provider: TN.Nova.cz.
      Note: I couldn't properly decode, how to get a video URL from a given
      article URL. In order to get this provider to work, I had to resort to 
      a very dirty hack, which sequentially tries a number of possible servers 
      to see if it can find the real one. That's slow, unreliable and above 
      all the provider could ban you for this kind of abuse of his servers.

    * New provider: Z1TV.cz.

    * CT24.cz: Support for URL format
      http://www.ct24.cz/vysilani/2010/02/10/10159875412-210411058030210-11:35-milenium/

    * MojeVideo.sk: The requirements for movie URLs were too strict, preventing
      some videos from being downloaded (for example 
      http://www.mojevideo.sk/video/654a/eduard_mila_tomasovi_gen.html).



  v0.60

    * New provider: DrsnySvet.cz (some sources only).

    * New provider: MojeVideo.sk.

    * New provider: Qip.ru (embedded movies only).

    * New provider: Studio-Plus.tv.

    * GameAnyone.com: Support for videos hosted directly on GameAnyone.com.
      This fix also works for any other providers which work through 
      third-party's servers, e.g. VideaCesky.cz or OverStream.net.

    * YouTube.com: Fixed a bug EStreamError which occured on videos without
      subtitles.



  v0.59

    * CeskaTelevize.cz: Support for URLs such as http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/873537-hledani-ztraceneho-casu/207522161510013-filmy-z-vaclavaku/.
      Note that not all pages in this format actually contain a video!

    * MustWatch.cz: Provider moved to a new domain.

    * YouTube.com: Support for downloading in other than highest-available
      quality. There are special settings in the config file that control
      this functionality. Their use is noted in the documentation
      (<max_video_width>, <max_video_height>).

      User pages (http://www.youtube.com/user/titanicpiano14) work again.

      Playlists (http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=90D6E7C4DE68E49E)
      work again.

      Support for subtitles. The first subtitles are downloaded by default,
      but you may select preferred languages and their priority in the config
      file. The subtitles are converted to .srt format by default, because
      YouTube uses a special format, but you can turn the conversion off. See 
      the documentation for details (<preferred_languages>, <convert_subtitles>).

    * Changed the way subtitles are downloaded: Now they are downloaded
      before the movie, not after it. Quite a few other changes were made,
      especially to providers without their own infrastructure (such as
      VideaCesky.cz); please report if you notice non-working subtitles where
      they used to work in previous versions.

      Subtitle support can now be turned on or off either globally or on
      per-provider basis. See the documenation for details (<subtitle_support>).

    * Location of provider-specific settings in the configuration file didn't
      match either documentation or sample config files. Fixed so that reality
      matches both documentation and examples (<modules>).



  v0.58

    * New provider: PrazdninyVTelci.cz.

    * New provider: TubeSSS.com (porn).

    * OverStream.net: Added support for subtitles.

    * PublicTV.cz: Support for multi-part movies (e.g.
      http://www.publictv.cz/cz/menu/3/videoarchiv/clanek-22184-jukebox-s-lenny/1935/)

    * TVcom.cz: Fixed incorrect parsing of title.

    * VideaCesky.cz: Yet another content format supported.

    * YouTube.com: Support for URLs which don't have video ID as the first
      parameter.

    * Subtitle support was rewritten for easy implementation with any provider.

    * MSDL downgraded to version 1.2.7, because I can't remember how I managed
      to compile the newer 1.2.7-r2 on Windows.



  v0.57

    * I forgot the debug code in. It is harmless, but also annoying.



  v0.56

    * New provider: NavratDoReality.cz
        - Note: Only movies hosted directly by NavratDoReality.cz are supported.
          Third-party-hosted videos are not supported.

    * New provider: TV7.cz

    * Another attempt at tackling the occasional baffling error "Download to
      file XY was not allowed."

    * Source HTML file (-s argument) can now be in UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding,
      too.

    * YouTube Downloader is now compatible with Delphi 2009.

    * The NativeXml library updated to version 3.10. This fixes national
      characters for some providers, e.g. TV Barrandov.

    * Fixed a hidden bug in the build script (wildcards in filenames weren't
      properly expanded before passing to the compiler).



  v0.55

    * Incorrect default value for encoding in TNativeXml caused invalid names 
      in XML-based providers.

    * The Delphi 2009 compatibility fixes caused a strange memory allocation
      bug, which manifested e.g. when downloading from TV Nova. It has been
      fixed, but it is possible the bug may still exist in other parts of the
      program.



  v0.54

    * iPrima.cz: Works again. New URL format supported.

    * Markiza.sk: Support for TalentMania.

    * More code changes that will eventually make YTD compatible with Delphi
      2009. Program can now be compiled by it, but don't bother, since it
      won't work - several key parts need to be rewritten first.



  v0.53

    * Vladimir Kubala (kubalav@gmail.com) created a slovakian translation.

    * New provider: OverStream.net

    * New provider: MustWatch.hztz.cz

    * New provider: CSmaTalent.cz, CSmaTalent.sk

    * VideaCesky.cz: Support for two more methods of embedding videos.

      Unfortunately, some of the movies are difficult to access for most users,
      because the provider happily ignores internet standards and uses invalid
      URLs with characters which shouldn't be there. Some browsers (such as
      Internet Explorer and Opera) then copy these invalid URLs to clipboard,
      preventing YTD from downloading them. Use Firefox, it accepts invalid
      URLs and encodes them to a proper format (such as http://www.videacesky.cz/skece-zabavne-scenky/george-carlin-%E2%80%93-nabozenstvi-je-kravina)
      before copying them to clipboard.

    * The definitive fix will have to wait until I manage to rewrite YTD for
      full compatibility with Delphi 2009.



  v0.52

    * New provider: AlternativaTV.cz

    * New provider: PCPlanets.com
        - The provider should work fine, but it keeps returning a HTTP error
          403 (forbidden). The same error is produced by the flash player
          itself, though, which makes it likely that the problem lies not in
          YTD but rather some bug or country restriction of PCPlanets.com.

    * Modified PerlRegEx to only contain Unicode support if compiled under
      Delphi 2009 and newer. In older Delphi this results in about 80 KB
      reduction of .exe file size.

    * Some under-the-hood modifications that will eventually result in
      compatibility with Delphi 2009+.



  v0.51
    
    * License terms change: YouTube Downloader is no longer distributed under
      the GNU GPL: a careful study of both GPL and the licenses of third-party
      libraries used in the application reveals that I don't have the right
      to release the program under GPL. YouTube Downloader is now being released
      under the "new BSD license", with third-party components (in directory
      Source/Lib) being governed by their own respective licenses. The details
      are described in the documentation.

    * GUI: Converters are now deactivated by default and must be activated in
      the configuration file before they can be used. The reason is, many people
      failed to read the documentation and instead started complaining that
      converters don't work (which was, and still is, expected - converters
      must be configured first). The activation steps are described in the
      documentation.

    * GUI: The conversion failure is now split: You can recognize whether the 
      conversion failed to even start or whether it started but failed to
      finish successfully.

    * GUI: An error message is displayed if you try to add an unsupported URL.

    * CeskaTelevize.cz:
      - Support for advertisments (specifically, skipping them).
      - Support for URLs like: http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/program/10252893246-07.08.2010-08:32-24-prizma.html

    * CT24.cz: Support for URLs like: http://www.ct24.cz/regionalni/87267-vrchlabsky-zamek-ma-vlastni-miniaturu/

    * VideaCesky.cz: Support for movies hosted directly on the server rather
      than on YouTube (e.g. http://www.videacesky.cz/ostatni/ceska-republika-narod-pivaru)

    * MSDL updated to version 1.2.7-r2.



  v0.50

    * Before the first start of the GUI version (that is, when a GUI version
      is stared but no configuration XML file exists), the program will ask
      you several questions in regards of configuration options which influence
      your privacy. Please pay close attention to these questions.
    
    * When starting the GUI, a check for new version is automatically
      performed. If you prefer not to do this check, there is an option
      to turn in off in the configuration. See the documentation for details.

    * Completely rewritten the way options are stored. Instead of the old
      weird combination of INI files and registry, YouTube Downloader now
      uses a XML file. This file can be stored either in the application
      directory or in the user's profile, depending on whether you use YTD
      as a portable application or a regular one. You'll find more details
      in the documentation.

    * Support for conversion or any other operation on successfully downloaded
      movies. The basic usage is described in the documentation in section 
      "Conversion of downloaded file", section "Configuration" provides 
      details on defining your own converters or changing the existing ones
      (search for <converters>).

    * GUI version now has a button for donations, if you feel like spending
      some money to help further development. Don't feel obliged to do so,
      though, the application is and will remain free regardless. It's more
      of a means of tracking how many people find my application useful
      than a source of income (besides, I would have to tax it if too many
      people donate, and I'd rather not have to do that).

    * The GUI version also provides a button for reporting non-working URLs.
      The function requires that you use the newest version of YTD. Before
      reporting an error, please make sure the problem is with YouTube
      Downloader and not your internet connection or the media provider's
      web site (for example, try that the movie plays fine if you try to
      load it in a web browser). Thank you.

      The error reporting is done through a special web form. The required
      fields will be filled in when you open it, but I urge you to fill in
      the description field and, if you want to get a response or in case
      I need more detailed info, an e-mail as well.

    * GUI version now has more detailed error messages.

    * An elusive long-standing bug, present since version 0.12 (though I first
      encountered it while working on version 0.41), which could cause random
      crashes after a download was finished, was found and squashed.

    * New providers:
        - AngryAlien.com
        - Blennus.com
        - Bolt.com (BoltAgain.ning.com)
        - Current.com
        - Dachix.com (porn)
        - DevilDucky.com
        - EmpFlix.com (porn)
        - EVTV1.com
        - Grinvi.com (porn)
        - NothingToxic.com
        - Revver.com
        - SlutLoad.com (porn)
        - Spankwire.com (porn)
        - TnaFlix.com (porn)
        - TotallyCrap.com
        - YouJizz.com (porn)

    * Barrandov.tv: Instead of the old .f4v extension a better .flv is used.

    * Break.com: Support for two variants of links to the embedded version.

    * VideaCesky.cz: Added support for an alternate embedding method, which
      should make previously non-downloadable movies work.

    * PornHub.com: Support for links to the embedded version. Fixed downloads
      of the regular (HTML) version.

    * Another significant change in the source code: I removed the old XML
      parsing component TjanXmlParser2 and replaced it with TNativeXml, which
      is still being developed, supports all versions of Delphi and is more
      more compatible with XML specs. Just like with regular expressions in
      the last version, this change may lead to some non-working providers,
      although I tried most of them and they seem to be fine.

    * YouTube Downloader can once again be built with FreePascal. A guide to
      building YTD is written in Source\build.txt. The build scripts were
      moved to Source, too.



  v0.40

    * New provider: Cas.sk.

    * New provider: MediaSport.cz.

    * Free.zoznam.sk: Video was saved with .php extension.

    * LiveLeak.com: Support for embedded videos (alternate link).

    * MSFotbal.ct24.cz: The original links on the "msfotbal" subdomain no
      longer exist, but you can still get to the videos using standard
      CT24.cz links.

    * Rozhlas.cz: Works again (it's not needed anymore, because the pages now 
      contain direct links to music, but since this provider is supported...).
      Fixed a bug which could lead to unwanted overwriting of files from the
      same page.

    * YouTube.com: Works again, after YouTube changed their pages.

    * GUI version: File-selection dialogs (opening or saving) now use interface
      of your Windows version, rather than the old Windows 98 interface used
      in older versions.

    * Command-line version: Support for result codes (errorlevel). The codes
      are listed in the main documentation.

    * Command-line version: An error in arguments or encounter of a "display"
      parameter (-?, -v, -l) causes YouTube Downloader to stop processing the
      command line and exit.

    * Some size-optimizations of the utility.

    * Fixed saving of unfinished URLs, which didn't work correctly if the
      download list was empty.

    * Switched to a new library for regular expressions. Program now uses
      TPerlRegExp instead of the old DPCRE. While this may cause some providers
      to stop working (I did check many of them, but not all of them), it 
      removed the dependency on PCRE.DLL and it is much more future-proof - 
      TPerlRegExp is still maintained and updated to new versions of PCRE,
      and it officially supports all versions of Delphi, including the new
      ones (2009, 2010).



  v0.39

    * GUI version: The list of unfinished URLs is automatically saved on change
      and loaded when the program starts. In effect, you can now quit YouTube
      Downloader and later continue with downloads where they finished. 
      
      If YTD is used in portable mode (DontUseRegistry=1), the INI file must be 
      writable for this function to work.

    * To facilitate the previous feature, default value for DontUseRegistry
      was changed to 0 - "use registry". If you want to run YouTube Downloader
      in portable mode, you MUST create the INI file and put DontUseRegistry=1
      into it.

    * VideaCesky.cz: Some movies couldn't be downloaded.

    * New provider: Aktualne.cz (Aktualne.Centrum.cz).

    * New provider: AutoTube.cz.

    * New provider: Bomba.cz.

    * New provider: DeutscheBahn.com.

    * New provider: GameAnyone.com.

    * New provider: iHned.cz.

    * New provider: Novinky.cz.

    * New provider: PublicTV.cz.



  v0.38

    * Support for alternate form of URLs for msfotbal.ct24.cz.

    * Updated YouTube support to changes from Jun 17, 2010.

    * GUI: Double click on a downloaded video plays that video in the default
      player (according to its extension).

    * New provider: CestyKSobe.cz



  v0.37

    * Some changes in the code result shortening of the command-line-only 
      version of YouTube Downloader in half - if you disable GUI, the
      executable file's size drops by more than a half of the original size.

      Optimizations of the GUI version are also planned.

      (I realize that, given today's disk sizes, no-one is impressed by 
      saved 100 KBs. But I just happen to like small programs...)

    * New provider: CT24.cz

    * New provider: MSFotbal.CT24.cz

    * New provider: STV.LiveTV.sk

    * Check for new version (CLI: argument -v; GUI: About window) didn't
      use proxy server even if it was set in the INI file.



  v0.36

    * Relaxed a too-strict check for valid conversions between UTF8 and
      Wide: unknown characters used to result in an error message, now they
      are simply replaced with question marks and conversion continues.
      (Solves an inconsistent behavior of CeskaTelevize.cz, which sometimes
      worked and sometimes didn't, even with the same URL.)

    * Localization support.

      - Using existing translations: In its default state, the program will
        load the language version that matches your Windows' locale. You may
        force a particular language by changing the Language option in the
        INI file.

      - Creating your own translations: Please read the documenation for
        details.



  v0.35

    * New providers:
        - 5min.com
        - eHow.com
        - ExtremeTube.com (note: porn)
        - Flickr.com
        - FreeVideo.ru
        - GrindTV.com
        - KeezMovies.com (note: porn)
        - Muzu.tv
        - RingTV.com
        - SevenLoad.com
        - Spike.com
        - Stagevu.com
        - StupidVideos.com
        - TodaysBigThing.com
        - University of Minnesota (ima.umn.edu)



  v0.34

    * Removed the forgotten console window in GUI version.

    * Updated support for MySpace. Note: Only movies hosted on MySpace servers
      can be downloaded. Movies hosted elsewhere (e.g. Hulu.com) can't.

    * Support for TV Noe (http://tvnoe.tbsystem.cz).

    * Support for FreeCaster.tv.

    * Support for Mpora.com.

    * Support for VitalMtb.com.

    * If an output file already exists and the user agreed to overwrite, YTD
      tries to delete the file first and only after that start writing to it.
      It's an attempt to solve a strange behavior of Windows 7, which won't
      let YTD write to a pre-existing file.



  v0.33

    * Stream.cz: support for HQ video.

    * Joj.sk: Implemented two more ways to detect video address. This should
      fix the three problems of some movies not downloading at all, other 
      movies being replaced by some other movies and some movies not being
      downloaded in HQ. Please make sure you check any downloads from Joj
      carefully, as Joj's backend is apparently rather shoddy and it is
      quite possible there are even more possible storage formats.

    * VideaCesky.cz: Subtitles are also downloaded.

    * Fixed missing .po files in the source of MSDL library. Those are only
      needed for clean build, of no interest for end-users.

    * Support for proxy servers. There are new settings ProxyHost, ProxyPort, 
      ProxyUser and ProxyPassword in the INI file. See documentation for
      details.



  v0.32

    * Slightly rearranged icons in the GUI version.

    * Support for MegaVideo.com and MegaPorn.com.

    * Support for Wimp.com.

    * Support for UStream.tv.

      Note for developers: The AMF support is incomplete as of yet - it does
      not handle AMF3 at all, for starters. The support will be expanded as
      (and when needed).



  v0.31

    * Invalid date format in Joj.sk handling caused downloading of a wrong
      movie.



  v0.30

    * Experimental support for Joj.sk. Due to the fact that URL geenrator
      makes a number of unwarranted assumptions, it is to be expected that
      some movies will not download. I will need to know their URLs to fix
      them.

    * Support for Metropol TV (tvpraha11.cz).

    * Support for VideaCesky.cz. The same method can be used for downloads
      from other secondary providers (who don't host their videos, but instead
      use someone else's servers).



  v0.29

    * More compatibility fixes for Free Pascal. GUI version won't work for
      quite a some time, perhaps forever.

    * Fixed a bug in RTMPDUMP (used by, e.g. TV Nova or Barrandov), which 
      only allowed one stream to download and failed with all successive
      streams.

      This bug also meant that if you tried to download two RTMP streams at
      the same time, they were both written to one file, rendering this file
      invalid. This behqavior is also fixed.

    * Introduced a concept of "ultimate providers", which allow finer control
      over simultaneously downloaded stream. For example, if a stream is
      currently being downloaded from Stream.cz, another request from iPrima.cz
      (which uses Stream.cz as a content provider) should wait.

    * The graphical version ignored the "PreferRealMedia" setting for Ceska
      Televize.cz.



  v0.28

    * Support for more media providers:
       - Facebook.com
       - Kukaj.sk
       - LibimSeTi.cz
       - MojeVideo.cz
       - Myubo.sk
       - Videoalbumy.azet.sk
       - Wrzuta.pl

    * Movies from Nova.cz now download in high quality (.mp4).

    * RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL was built with library PolarSSL rather than OpenSSL,
      which removes the dependency on CRYPTOEAY32-0.9.8.DLL and
      SSLEAY32-0.9.8.DLL. It means that RTMPDUMP_DLL grew by some 180 KB,
      though.

    * Program can now be built with FreePascal (http://www.freepascal.org),
      tested with version 2.4.0. Only command-line version is supported for
      now, though - GUI version (using project Lazarus) can be built, but
      won't run in GUI mode.



  v0.27

    * Support for more media providers:
       - Bing.com
       - Bofunk.com

    * Added english documentation.

    * Cleaned-up licensing terms: The program is released under the
      GNU GPL3 license.

    * More source code cleanup.

    * RTMPDUMP updated to version 2.2d.

    * The RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of RTMPDUMP, too.

    * The MSDL_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of MSDL, too.

    * Support for an INI file with default values. See documentation for
      details.

    * Czech Television is now being downloaded in the highest quality. You can
      now choose between Windows Media (default) and Real Media streams (in
      the INI file).

    * Fixed download of Czech Television's program PORT so that the program is
      downloaded rather than advertisment.

    * Command-line argument -l shows a list of available providers.

    * Command-line argument -v tests for availability of a newer version.

    * GUI version has a new button 'About' (F1), which displays some basic 
      information about the program and checks for availability of a newer
      version. It shows a list of available providers (what you get if you
      use the -l argument on command-line), too.

    * Movies from YouTube have their filenames properly converted to ANSI
      encoding.



  v0.26

    * Support for YouTube channels (pages containing content of a particular
      user, e.g. http://www.youtube.com/titanicpiano14). They are handled in
      much the same way as playlists.



  v0.25

    * Support for Snotr.com.



  v0.24

    * Some YouTube videos couldn't be downloaded with the age-verification-
      bypass method of the last version, but they did work with the older
      download method of version 0.22. The code was modified to first try
      the age-verification-bypass method, and if unsuccessful, fall back
      to the old method.

      Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REpXf0cmJ64



  v0.23

    * Re-worked playlist support for less cluttered output in command-line
      version. This also allows faster and easier support for more playlist
      formats.

    * Support for "adult" videos at YouTube.

    * Parameter -e for logging failed downloads to a file.

    * Parameter -s for reading links from HTML source. Both local files and
      remote URLs are supported. Example:

      ytd.exe -s "http://www.somewebsite.com/movies.html"
      ytd.exe -s "c:\temp\movies.html"

    * Functions for reading URL list from listfile (like -i in CLI version)
      and reading URL list from HTML page or HTML file (like -s in CLI) were
      added to the graphical version.

    * GUI version can now save the list of unfinished downloads to a list
      file, which can be later read using the -i parameter.



  v0.22

    * GUI version now displays hints for each button.

    * Changed the default behavior when an existing file is encountered. The
      older versions used to overwrite such a file. This version asks the
      user what to do.

      You may use parameters -n (never overwrite - skip), -a (automatically
      overwrite - like the older versions), -r (rename automatically) and
      -k (ask) to define the behavior in advance.

      GUI version always asks, except when "Auto-overwrite" is checked - in
      that case existing files are automatically overwritten like in the older
      versions.

    * GUI version minimizes to system tray.

    * YouTube playlists (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=90D6E7C4DE68E49E)
      are supported. All videos on a playlist are scheduled for download.



  v0.21

    * The changes in version 0.19 apparently rendered HTTP-based providers,
      such as YouTube, inoperative. Fixed.



  v0.20

    * Czech TV: Support for program PORT.



  v0.19

    * Memory leaks due some un-freed regular expressions fixed.

    * YouTube: Video "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INIRLe7x0Y" was saved
      with ".mp4" extension, although it really is a ".flv". It is possible
      you will encounter more such cases, because I don't have a full list
      of supported formats and their respective extensions. Just let me know
      the URL of a video with incorrect extension and I will fix it.

    * Support for http://www.tvcom.cz.

    * Support for http://www.markiza.sk. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.

    * Support for http://www.rozhlas.cz. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.



  v0.18

    * Support for the new YouTube design.



  v0.17

    * Support for MMS, MMSH, RTSP protocols and their tunnelling variants.
      You will need MSDL_DLL.DLL library, built as a slight modification of
      MSDL tool (http://msdl.sf.net).

    * Support for Czech TV (iVysilani).

    * RTMPDUMP updated to its current version.



  v0.16

    * Shortened output lines in command-line version, to work better with
      100+ MB files in default console size.

    * Support for TV Nova (nova.cz).



  v0.15:
  
    * Restructured source code to better facilitate new media sources.

    * Support for streams based on RTMP protocol. It is done through
      RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library, which is based on RTMPDUMP project
      (http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu). The library requires OpenSSL 
      in version 0.9.8, specifically the libraries SSLEAY32-0.9.8.DLL
      and CRYPTOEAY32-0.9.8.DLL.

    * Support for Barrandov.tv.



  v0.14:

    * The changes for Stream.cz caused the other sources to stop working.

    * Updated the graphical interface (icons, buttons etc.).

    * Added support for building only CLI or only GUI version of the
      program: When calling BUILD.BAT, use the optional argument "CLI"
      (only command-line version) or "GUI" (only graphical version).
      Building just CLI version results in a much smaller EXE file,
      just GUI version gets rid of the console window. The default
      behavior is to use both CLI and GUI support in the same EXE file.

    * The Synapse library updated to release 39. Unfortunately, this does
      not fix the Stream.cz problem (see below).

    * Support for iPrima.cz (based on Stream.cz).



  v0.13:

    * Support for Stream.cz. Unfortunately, it contains an unknown error
      that occassionally occurs - see the main readme file.

    * Besides video name and file the CLI version now also displays the URL,
      which can be used - with some providers - to download movies using
      your favorite download manager.



  v0.12:

    * Fixed YouTube downloader to once again support movies without a HD
      version.
    
    * The graphical version was completely rebuilt. Now it shows an URL list,
      downloads multiple files at once etc.



  v0.11:

    * YouTube: Experimental support for higher-quality HD formats (720HQ,
      1080p). Please let me know if you encounter a video which doesn't
      work.



  v0.10:

    * The program was rewritten from scratch. Now it is possible to add
      support for more media providers than just YouTube.

    * All outputs were changed to an easier-to-read form.

    * Support for n-joy.cz.

    * Support for blip.tv.

    * Support for files with URL list (one URL per line) with parameter -i.

    * PCRE.DLL is now required.

    * Added version info and icon to the application.

    * Added a very simple graphical interface, which is displayed if the
      program is started without arguments.



  v0.06:

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/v/(id)



  v0.05:

    * Cleaned up source codes and the build batch-file.

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/watch/v/(id)
