CHANGELOG
---------

  v0.32

    * Slightly rearranged icons in the GUI version.

    * Support for MegaVideo.com and MegaPorn.com.

    * Support for Wimp.com.

    * Support for UStream.tv.

      Note for developers: The AMF support is incomplete as of yet - it does
      not handle AMF3 at all, for starters. The support will be expanded as
      (and when needed).



  v0.31

    * Invalid date format in Joj.sk handling caused downloading of a wrong
      movie.



  v0.30

    * Experimental support for Joj.sk. Due to the fact that URL geenrator
      makes a number of unwarranted assumptions, it is to be expected that
      some movies will not download. I will need to know their URLs to fix
      them.

    * Support for Metropol TV (tvpraha11.cz).

    * Support for VideaCesky.cz. The same method can be used for downloads
      from other secondary providers (who don't host their videos, but instead
      use someone else's servers).



  v0.29

    * More compatibility fixes for Free Pascal. GUI version won't work for
      quite a some time, perhaps forever.

    * Fixed a bug in RTMPDUMP (used by, e.g. TV Nova or Barrandov), which 
      only allowed one stream to download and failed with all successive
      streams.

      This bug also meant that if you tried to download two RTMP streams at
      the same time, they were both written to one file, rendering this file
      invalid. This behqavior is also fixed.

    * Introduced a concept of "ultimate providers", which allow finer control
      over simultaneously downloaded stream. For example, if a stream is
      currently being downloaded from Stream.cz, another request from iPrima.cz
      (which uses Stream.cz as a content provider) should wait.

    * The graphical version ignored the "PreferRealMedia" setting for Ceska
      Televize.cz.



  v0.28

    * Support for more media providers:
       - Facebook.com
       - Kukaj.sk
       - LibimSeTi.cz
       - MojeVideo.cz
       - Myubo.sk
       - Videoalbumy.azet.sk
       - Wrzuta.pl

    * Movies from Nova.cz now download in high quality (.mp4).

    * RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL was built with library PolarSSL rather than OpenSSL,
      which removes the dependency on CRYPTOEAY32-0.9.8.DLL and
      SSLEAY32-0.9.8.DLL. It means that RTMPDUMP_DLL grew by some 180 KB,
      though.

    * Program can now be built with FreePascal (http://www.freepascal.org),
      tested with version 2.4.0. Only command-line version is supported for
      now, though - GUI version (using project Lazarus) can be built, but
      won't run in GUI mode.



  v0.27

    * Support for more media providers:
       - Bing.com
       - Bofunk.com
       - Break.com.

    * Added english documentation.

    * Cleaned-up licensing terms: The program is released under the
      GNU GPL3 license.

    * More source code cleanup.

    * RTMPDUMP updated to version 2.2d.

    * The RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of RTMPDUMP, too.

    * The MSDL_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of MSDL, too.

    * Support for an INI file with default values. See documentation for
      details.

    * Czech Television is now being downloaded in the highest quality. You can
      now choose between Windows Media (default) and Real Media streams (in
      the INI file).

    * Fixed download of Czech Television's program PORT so that the program is
      downloaded rather than advertisment.

    * Command-line argument -l shows a list of available providers.

    * Command-line argument -v tests for availability of a newer version.

    * GUI version has a new button 'About' (F1), which displays some basic 
      information about the program and checks for availability of a newer
      version. It shows a list of available providers (what you get if you
      use the -l argument on command-line), too.

    * Movies from YouTube have their filenames properly converted to ANSI
      encoding.



  v0.26

    * Support for YouTube channels (pages containing content of a particular
      user, e.g. http://www.youtube.com/titanicpiano14). They are handled in
      much the same way as playlists.



  v0.25

    * Support for Snotr.com.



  v0.24

    * Some YouTube videos couldn't be downloaded with the age-verification-
      bypass method of the last version, but they did work with the older
      download method of version 0.22. The code was modified to first try
      the age-verification-bypass method, and if unsuccessful, fall back
      to the old method.

      Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REpXf0cmJ64



  v0.23

    * Re-worked playlist support for less cluttered output in command-line
      version. This also allows faster and easier support for more playlist
      formats.

    * Support for "adult" videos at YouTube.

    * Parameter -e for logging failed downloads to a file.

    * Parameter -s for reading links from HTML source. Both local files and
      remote URLs are supported. Example:

      ytd.exe -s "http://www.somewebsite.com/movies.html"
      ytd.exe -s "c:\temp\movies.html"

    * Functions for reading URL list from listfile (like -i in CLI version)
      and reading URL list from HTML page or HTML file (like -s in CLI) were
      added to the graphical version.

    * GUI version can now save the list of unfinished downloads to a list
      file, which can be later read using the -i parameter.



  v0.22

    * GUI version now displays hints for each button.

    * Changed the default behavior when an existing file is encountered. The
      older versions used to overwrite such a file. This version asks the
      user what to do.

      You may use parameters -n (never overwrite - skip), -a (automatically
      overwrite - like the older versions), -r (rename automatically) and
      -k (ask) to define the behavior in advance.

      GUI version always asks, except when "Auto-overwrite" is checked - in
      that case existing files are automatically overwritten like in the older
      versions.

    * GUI version minimizes to system tray.

    * YouTube playlists (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=90D6E7C4DE68E49E)
      are supported. All videos on a playlist are scheduled for download.



  v0.21

    * The changes in version 0.19 apparently rendered HTTP-based providers,
      such as YouTube, inoperative. Fixed.



  v0.20

    * Czech TV: Support for program PORT.



  v0.19

    * Memory leaks due some un-freed regular expressions fixed.

    * YouTube: Video "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INIRLe7x0Y" was saved
      with ".mp4" extension, although it really is a ".flv". It is possible
      you will encounter more such cases, because I don't have a full list
      of supported formats and their respective extensions. Just let me know
      the URL of a video with incorrect extension and I will fix it.

    * Support for http://www.tvcom.cz.

    * Support for http://www.markiza.sk. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.

    * Support for http://www.rozhlas.cz. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.



  v0.18

    * Support for the new YouTube design.



  v0.17

    * Support for MMS, MMSH, RTSP protocols and their tunnelling variants.
      You will need MSDL_DLL.DLL library, built as a slight modification of
      MSDL tool (http://msdl.sf.net).

    * Support for Czech TV (iVysilani).

    * RTMPDUMP updated to its current version.



  v0.16

    * Shortened output lines in command-line version, to work better with
      100+ MB files in default console size.

    * Support for TV Nova (nova.cz).



  v0.15:
  
    * Restructured source code to better facilitate new media sources.

    * Support for streams based on RTMP protocol. It is done through
      RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library, which is based on RTMPDUMP project
      (http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu). The library requires OpenSSL 
      in version 0.9.8, specifically the libraries SSLEAY32-0.9.8.DLL
      and CRYPTOEAY32-0.9.8.DLL.

    * Support for Barrandov.tv.



  v0.14:

    * The changes for Stream.cz caused the other sources to stop working.

    * Updated the graphical interface (icons, buttons etc.).

    * Added support for building only CLI or only GUI version of the
      program: When calling BUILD.BAT, use the optional argument "CLI"
      (only command-line version) or "GUI" (only graphical version).
      Building just CLI version results in a much smaller EXE file,
      just GUI version gets rid of the console window. The default
      behavior is to use both CLI and GUI support in the same EXE file.

    * The Synapse library updated to release 39. Unfortunately, this does
      not fix the Stream.cz problem (see below).

    * Support for iPrima.cz (based on Stream.cz).



  v0.13:

    * Support for Stream.cz. Unfortunately, it contains an unknown error
      that occassionally occurs - see the main readme file.

    * Besides video name and file the CLI version now also displays the URL,
      which can be used - with some providers - to download movies using
      your favorite download manager.



  v0.12:

    * Fixed YouTube downloader to once again support movies without a HD
      version.
    
    * The graphical version was completely rebuilt. Now it shows an URL list,
      downloads multiple files at once etc.



  v0.11:

    * YouTube: Experimental support for higher-quality HD formats (720HQ,
      1080p). Please let me know if you encounter a video which doesn't
      work.



  v0.10:

    * The program was rewritten from scratch. Now it is possible to add
      support for more media providers than just YouTube.

    * All outputs were changed to an easier-to-read form.

    * Support for n-joy.cz.

    * Support for blip.tv.

    * Support for files with URL list (one URL per line) with parameter -i.

    * PCRE.DLL is now required.

    * Added version info and icon to the application.

    * Added a very simple graphical interface, which is displayed if the
      program is started without arguments.



  v0.06:

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/v/(id)



  v0.05:

    * Cleaned up source codes and the build batch-file.

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/watch/v/(id)
