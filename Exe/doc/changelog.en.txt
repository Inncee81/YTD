    * Added english documentation.

    * Cleaned-up licensing terms: The program is released under the
      GNU GPL3 license.

    * More source code cleanup.

    * RTMPDUMP updated to version 2.2d.

    * The RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of RTMPDUMP, too.

    * The MSDL_DLL.DLL library has been modified for easier maintenance.
      It now allows the full use of all features of MSDL, too.

    * Support for an INI file with default values. See documentation for
      details.

    * Czech Television is now being downloaded in the highest quality. You can
      now choose between Windows Media (default) and Real Media streams (in
      the INI file).

    * Fixed download of Czech Television's program PORT so that the program is
      downloaded rather than advertisment.

    * Command-line argument -l shows a list of available providers.

    * Command-line argument -v tests for availability of a newer version.

    * GUI version has a new button 'About' (F1), which displays some basic 
      information about the program and checks for availability of a newer
      version. It shows a list of available providers (what you get if you
      use the -l argument on command-line), too.

    * Movies from YouTube have their filenames properly converted to ANSI
      encoding.



  v0.26

    * Support for YouTube channels (pages containing content of a particular
      user, e.g. http://www.youtube.com/titanicpiano14). They are handled in
      much the same way as playlists.



  v0.25

    * Support for Snotr.com.



  v0.24

    * Some YouTube videos couldn't be downloaded with the age-verification-
      bypass method of the last version, but they did work with the older
      download method of version 0.22. The code was modified to first try
      the age-verification-bypass method, and if unsuccessful, fall back
      to the old method.

      Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REpXf0cmJ64



  v0.23

    * Re-worked playlist support for less cluttered output in command-line
      version. This also allows faster and easier support for more playlist
      formats.

    * Support for "adult" videos at YouTube.

    * Parameter -e for logging failed downloads to a file.

    * Parameter -s for reading links from HTML source. Both local files and
      remote URLs are supported. Example:

      ytd.exe -s "http://www.somewebsite.com/movies.html"
      ytd.exe -s "c:\temp\movies.html"

    * Functions for reading URL list from listfile (like -i in CLI version)
      and reading URL list from HTML page or HTML file (like -s in CLI) were
      added to the graphical version.

    * GUI version can now save the list of unfinished downloads to a list
      file, which can be later read using the -i parameter.



  v0.22

    * GUI version now displays hints for each button.

    * Changed the default behavior when an existing file is encountered. The
      older versions used to overwrite such a file. This version asks the
      user what to do.

      You may use parameters -n (never overwrite - skip), -a (automatically
      overwrite - like the older versions), -r (rename automatically) and
      -k (ask) to define the behavior in advance.

      GUI version always asks, except when "Auto-overwrite" is checked - in
      that case existing files are automatically overwritten like in the older
      versions.

    * GUI version minimizes to system tray.

    * YouTube playlists (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=90D6E7C4DE68E49E)
      are supported. All videos on a playlist are scheduled for download.



  v0.21

    * The changes in version 0.19 apparently rendered HTTP-based providers,
      such as YouTube, inoperative. Fixed.



  v0.20

    * Czech TV: Support for program PORT.



  v0.19

    * Memory leaks due some un-freed regular expressions fixed.

    * YouTube: Video "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INIRLe7x0Y" was saved
      with ".mp4" extension, although it really is a ".flv". It is possible
      you will encounter more such cases, because I don't have a full list
      of supported formats and their respective extensions. Just let me know
      the URL of a video with incorrect extension and I will fix it.

    * Support for http://www.tvcom.cz.

    * Support for http://www.markiza.sk. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.

    * Support for http://www.rozhlas.cz. If a movie consists of several
      files, all will be downloaded.



  v0.18

    * Support for the new YouTube design.



  v0.17

    * Support for MMS, MMSH, RTSP protocols and their tunnelling variants.
      You will need MSDL_DLL.DLL library, built as a slight modification of
      MSDL tool (http://msdl.sf.net).

    * Support for Czech TV (iVysilani).

    * RTMPDUMP updated to its current version.



  v0.16

    * Shortened output lines in command-line version, to work better with
      100+ MB files in default console size.

    * Support for TV Nova (nova.cz).



  v0.15:
  
    * Restructured source code to better facilitate new media sources.

    * Support for streams based on RTMP protocol. It is done through
      RTMPDUMP_DLL.DLL library, which is based on RTMPDUMP project
      (http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu). The library requires OpenSSL 
      in version 0.9.8, specifically the libraries SSLEAY32-0.9.8.DLL
      and CRYPTOEAY32-0.9.8.DLL.

    * Support for Barrandov.tv.



  v0.14:

    * The changes for Stream.cz caused the other sources to stop working.

    * Updated the graphical interface (icons, buttons etc.).

    * Added support for building only CLI or only GUI version of the
      program: When calling BUILD.BAT, use the optional argument "CLI"
      (only command-line version) or "GUI" (only graphical version).
      Building just CLI version results in a much smaller EXE file,
      just GUI version gets rid of the console window. The default
      behavior is to use both CLI and GUI support in the same EXE file.

    * The Synapse library updated to release 39. Unfortunately, this does
      not fix the Stream.cz problem (see below).

    * Support for iPrima.cz (based on Stream.cz).



  v0.13:

    * Support for Stream.cz. Unfortunately, it contains an unknown error
      that occassionally occurs - see the main readme file.

    * Besides video name and file the CLI version now also displays the URL,
      which can be used - with some providers - to download movies using
      your favorite download manager.



  v0.12:

    * Fixed YouTube downloader to once again support movies without a HD
      version.
    
    * The graphical version was completely rebuilt. Now it shows an URL list,
      downloads multiple files at once etc.



  v0.11:

    * YouTube: Experimental support for higher-quality HD formats (720HQ,
      1080p). Please let me know if you encounter a video which doesn't
      work.



  v0.10:

    * The program was rewritten from scratch. Now it is possible to add
      support for more media providers than just YouTube.

    * All outputs were changed to an easier-to-read form.

    * Support for n-joy.cz.

    * Support for blip.tv.

    * Support for files with URL list (one URL per line) with parameter -i.

    * PCRE.DLL is now required.

    * Added version info and icon to the application.

    * Added a very simple graphical interface, which is displayed if the
      program is started without arguments.



  v0.06:

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/v/(id)



  v0.05:

    * Cleaned up source codes and the build batch-file.

    * Support for URLs like http://www.youtube.com/watch/v/(id)
