This is a simple launcher for YTD.exe, intended for use with 7-zip's 7zS2.sfx
installer module. Basically, it performs a minor modification of the supplied
command-line to reflect different defaults when the program is started from 
the distribution archive (no arguments -> start graphical Setup, otherwise run
in CLI mode) and when it is started from the installed location (no arguments
-> run in GUI mode, otherwise run in CLI mode).

Actually, this is mostly a pointless excercise in Win32 assembler, as the same
thing can easily be done using a batch file (see setup.bat). But I rather like
assembler and besides, non-batch execution allows for a completely hidden
"Setup" launcher.

See the 7-zip "extra" package for details on 7zS2.sfx.

Building Setup requires MASM32. Update build.bat to point to MASM's directory
and then run it.
